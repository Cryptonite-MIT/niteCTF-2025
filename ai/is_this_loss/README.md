**Author:** `tryhard`

**Description:** You are given access to a trained neural network through a forward-pass oracle. The model was trained using the loss function shown in the provided image, but all scalar parameters are hidden. Your task is to **recover the exact numeric values of the loss parameters** used during training. You may interact with the model only via `oracle.py`; run it and follow the on-screen instructions to query the model as many times as needed. The flag must be submitted in the following exact format, with values in the correct order and precision preserved:** `nite{alpha_beta_gamma_delta_tau}` (example:** `nite{7.0_0.9_0.1_0.1_0.1}`). Only the correct parameters will be accepted.
