**Description:**

In the ancient Archives of Melodia, there exists a legend of the Songweavers - mystics who could weave prophecies into pure sound, hiding truths within melodies that only the worthy could unravel.

The last known Songweaver, Master Kaelen, vanished centuries ago during the War of Silence. Before disappearing, he left behind a single artifact: a crystalline sphere that hums with an otherworldly resonance.

Scholars have tried for generations to unlock its meaning. Every attempt has failed. The sphere's song sounds like chaos - discordant, broken, meaningless.

But recently, excavators unearthed Kaelen's hidden workshop beneath the Archives. Inside, they found his personal collection: practice melodies he composed, fragments of his experimental harmonies, and a weathered tome containing his theories on sonic encryption.

The Archives' lore-keepers now believe the sphere doesn't contain a broken song - it contains a hidden one. Kaelen wove his final prophecy into frequencies that speak only to those who reconstruct his lost art.
