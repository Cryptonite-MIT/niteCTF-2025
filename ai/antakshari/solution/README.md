Project the latent embeddings of the bipartite actor–movie graph into a 2-dimensional space using t-SNE or UMAP to spot structural patterns in the embeddings. Then locate the densest cluster of actor nodes in the projected space using the (`solve.py`) . These nodes are then extracted in descending order, as required by the verification step. Using these ordered node IDs are to be submitted on the web-checker in decending order to obtian the final flag.
