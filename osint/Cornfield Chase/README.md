# Cornfield Chase

**Flag:** `nite{1'v3_b33n_w41t1ng_f0r_y0u_4t_cape_no._7}`
- We notice that the utility poles shown in the challenge have diagonal black-and-yellow stripes, and the surrounding area contains rice paddies. According to [Geotips (Asia – Utility Poles)](https://geotips.net/asia/), this tells us the location is Taiwan.

- Additionally, the pole in the image contains identifiable markings:

- Taiwanese utility poles include sector indicators and percentage markers that can be used to determine their exact geographic position:

- From the label **“N”**, we determine that the pole is located in **Chiayi City**. The two numbers following it allow us to pinpoint its position:
    - **04:** horizontal position (x-axis) as a percentage
    - **89:** vertical position (y-axis) as a percentage

- These values indicate that the pole is near the top northern edge of **Sector N**.

- The characters **「朴 佳」** correspond to **Pu Jia**, referring to **Puzi City**.

- In the challenge image, a highway-like structure is visible. Examining Puzi City on Google Maps reveal a  similar structure. Exploring the relevant area eventually leads to the exact matching location, where the flag can be found:
