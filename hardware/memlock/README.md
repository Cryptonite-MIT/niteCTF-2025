**Description**: A high-security facility's electronic lock stands between you and critical intelligence. You've managed to extract the firmware, but the passphrase is locked away behind layers of obfuscation. Your breakthrough comes from an unexpected source, the lock's hardware schematic, hastily discarded in the trash near the installation site. Analyze the layout or remain locked out. The flag awaits on the other side.
