**Description**: AetherCorp has been running this old service for years. Nobody really knows who built it, or why parts of it still depend on outdated systems.
The files are messy, the documentation is gone, and every department claims someone else maintains it.
Now it’s acting strange again, and they just pushed it onto your environment without explanation.
Whatever is inside this system... it wasn’t meant to stay buried forever.
